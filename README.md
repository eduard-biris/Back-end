# Visualize

Framework of Federated and Dynamically LoadedÂ Visualizations



## Prerequisites

In order to be able to run the applications on your local system, you need to have the following tools installed:
 - Node.js v18.19
 


## Installation

First, create a new directory and clone the following repositories:
 - Data Manager: https://github.com/eduard-biris/Back-end
 - High Level API: https://github.com/eduard-biris/TypeScriptClient
 - Shell UI: https://github.com/eduard-biris/Host-app
 - Microfrontend: https://github.com/eduard-biris/Micro-front-ends

Next, run the following command in all newly-created directories:

```
npm install
```


## Running the application

Go in all the directories except the High Level API and run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

To use the high-level API, you can write your own code directly in the High Level API cloned repository, or use some pre-defined visualizations. For more details, see the script.js file from the High Level API repository.
